## [Unreleased]

First public release of the IRIS harness.

### Changed

- Destructive tools and pinned writes now get a durable side-effect ledger row before
  they run (issue #73). This needs no flag: with `IRIS_GOVERNANCE_SIDE_EFFECT_LEDGER`
  unset the ledger covers that high-risk class only, and plain writes and reads are
  unchanged (no row, no file). Behavior change for deployments that set
  `IRIS_GOVERNANCE_SIDE_EFFECT_LEDGER=0`: a destructive tool or pinned write is now denied
  rather than run with no durable record. Remove the setting, or set it to `1` to also
  record every non-read call, to run them again.

### Added

- The governed agent harness (`iris_harness`): intent routing, planning, a ReAct
  tool loop, response curation, and tiered LLM routing across local (Ollama, LM
  Studio) and opt-in cloud models.
- The governance kernel every model and tool call passes through: data
  classification, an egress gate, a Fernet vault, hooks, an evaluator, human
  approvals and an audit ledger.
- A plugin SDK (`iris_harness.sdk`) with profiles and three discovery paths
  (built-in, `iris_harness.plugins` entry points, `$IRIS_HOME/plugins`), plus the
  reference plugins `system`, `research`, `code_exec`, `telegram_channel`,
  `web_channel`, `web_push_channel` and `graphiti_import`.
- memris (`memris`), the memory graph of claims the harness remembers with.
- The IRIS API and Governor services, the `iris` CLI, a React web console, and a
  Docker Compose stack with a bundled Ollama.
